			<h2>Makedah Shartukar, Co-Founder & CEO</h2>
			<p>Makedah’s inclusive and collaborative leadership style, her love of and curiosity of people coupled with the global perspective gained through her African and Filipino heritage and experiences living overseas created the entrepreneurial mind and sharing spirit within her today.  She possesses an almost uncanny ability to recognize and connect disparate parts whether it be information, people, ideas or solutions in a manner that has others labeling her as a “Creative Visionary”.</p> 
			<p>She received her B.S. degree in Business Administration from Cal State University, Hayward  before amassing 15 years of experience in the high-tech industry in HR Management and Supplier Diversity with several Silicon Valley corporations. Makedah moved on from Silicon Valley to become a top producing real estate agent that specialized in the Default Industry where she worked with Bank of America, GMAC and Wells Fargo.</p>
			<p>Makedah’s entrepreneurial desire could not be denied causing her to throw caution to the winds and leave corporate America to start her own consulting firm focused on supplier diversity and small business inclusion. Her firm worked with large corporations and on major commercial construction projects including the Transbay Transit Center Project, the upcoming historical Ghana National Museum on Slavery and with exciting new start-ups such as Black Girls Code.</p>
			<p>Given her first hand experiences running a small business dedicated to connecting small business to large business, her role in corporate America sourcing talent, contractors, suppliers and small business inclusion brought home to her the real time problems connecting small business and large corporations. She had her “AHA!”  moment and launched BILD-Connect.com.</p>
